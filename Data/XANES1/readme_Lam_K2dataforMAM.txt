notes on Lam_K2dataforMAM *.e files
All *.e files (pre-edge removed, normalized K-edge FeXANES) were from spectra taken at 10.3.2 at the ALS in October 2006 and March 2007 by Phoebe Lam.  Many samples had XANES spectra taken during both beamtimes.  All samples are from Station K2 in the Subarctic Northwest Pacific, collected during the VERTIGO program in 2005.

Sample names are generally of the form:
200nnnnMQ_FeXANES_spotn.e, 200nnnnMQmar_*, 200nnnnP_*, or Vnnnn*
-where 200nnnn is the sample ID from in-situ filtration (uniquely denotes the depth and cast from which the sample came)
-MQ or P following the sample ID denotes the filter types "Micro Quartz" (1-51um size fraction) or "Prefilter" (>51um size fraction), respectively
-if "mar" follows the sample ID and filter type, the spectra were collected in March 2007; otherwise all spectra were collected in October 2006
-Vnnnn* sample ID denotes a sediment trap sample
-*quadratic.e means that a quadratic function was used to normalize the data (flag for potential poor quality data)
