notes on Lam_SAZSENSEdataforMAM *.e files
All *.e files (pre-edge removed, normalized K-edge FeXANES) were from spectra taken at 10.3.2 at the ALS in September 2007 and December 2008 by Phoebe Lam.  Many samples had XANES spectra taken during both beamtimes.  All samples were collected by Phoebe Lam by McLane in-situ filtration during the SAZ-SENSE project in the Southern Ocean south of Tasmania in January-February 2007. 

Sample names are generally of the form:
SSMnnn_FeXANES_spotn.e or SSMnnn_spotn_FeXANES_Dec08.e
-where SSMnnn is the sample ID (uniquely denotes the cruise, depth and cast from which the sample came)
-if "Dec08" follows the sample ID, the spectra were collected in Dec08; otherwise all spectra were collected in September 2007
-all samples are on quartz fiber filters (1-51um size fraction)
